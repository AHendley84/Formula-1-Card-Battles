# Formula 1 Card Battles
## Interactive Front End Development Project

For my second project I am creating a Top Trumps style game using the 2023 Formula 1 championships drivers and teams. The game involves a deck of 20 cards representing each current driver from the 10 teams that represent the Formula 1 world championship. The aim is to reduce your opponentâ€™s cards pile to zero. If this is achieved the player will be notified that they have won, however, if the computer obtains all their cards they will be notified of their loss.

    - As a first time visitor,  I want to get to understand the main purpose of the site.
    - As a first time visitor,  I want to receive feedback on how I'm progressing in the game.
    - As a first time visitor,  I want to know if I've won or lost the game.

### Color Scheme
The colors selected for the color palette are colors that are usually associated with Formula One:
- Red for the lights out signal to start the race.
- White and black for the chequered flag and green
- Yellow to indicate to drivers if there is caution ahead
- Green to dictate that normal racing can resume.

### Scorecard and game progress message board.
The score card displays the number of card held by the player and the computer. The message board displays an initital message to confirm the game has started and will then display who won the previous round or if it was a tie.

### Player / Computer Win Pages
Two individual pages to tell the player if they have won or if the computer has one. There is a button on each page to take you back into the game to play another round!

### User Story Testing

### Lighthouse Test

### Resposiveness

### Bugs
- Bug 1 - Nationality on the active computer card was displaying a number
Issue: 
```
compNat.innerText = `${computerCardCurrent[0].driverChampionships}`;
```
The above line of code was pointing to the number of drivers championships rather than the nationality.
Fix:
```
compNat.innerText = `${computerCardCurrent[0].nationality}`;
```
Amending the code to look at the nationality inside the active card object resolved the issue.

- Bug 2 - Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'img1')
Issue: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'img1')
```
function assignCurrentCard() {
    const playerCurrent = Math.floor((Math.random() * playerCards.length));
    const computerCurrent = Math.floor((Math.random() * computerCards.length));

    playerCardCurrent.push(playerCards.splice(playerCurrent, 1)[0]);
    computerCardCurrent.push(computerCards.splice(computerCurrent, 1)[0]);
};
```
The above error kept occuring in the console. What was visibile in the game was the drivers name, team name and the drivers would change, however, the drivers image and team image would remain the same as the previous card. I tried multiple times to understand what was casuing the issue but couldn't see from the code what was causing it. I searched via Google for some answers and found generic responses to the error code, but none that would fix the issue. I decided to reach out to the #project-milestone-2 channel for some guidance. The guidance helped me fix and improve my code.
Fix:
```
function assignCurrentCard() {
    if (playerCards.length > 0) {
        const playerCurrent = Math.floor((Math.random() * playerCards.length));
        playerCardCurrent.push(playerCards.splice(playerCurrent, 1)[0]);
    };

    if (computerCards.length > 0) {
        const computerCurrent = Math.floor((Math.random() * computerCards.length));
        computerCardCurrent.push(computerCards.splice(computerCurrent, 1)[0]);
    };
    displayImages();
    displayDriverStats();
};
```
