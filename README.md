# Formula 1 Card Battles
## Interactive Front End Development Project

For my second project I am creating a Top Trumps style game using the 2023 Formula 1 championships drivers and teams. The game involves a deck of 20 cards representing each current driver from the 10 teams that represent the Formula 1 world championship. The aim is to reduce your opponentâ€™s cards pile to zero. If this is achieved the player will be notified that they have won, however, if the computer obtains all their cards they will be notified of their loss.

## User Experience (UX) & Design
---
### User Stories
- First Time Visitor

    - As a first time visitor,  I want to get to understand the main purpose of the site.
    - As a first time visitor,  I want to receive feedback on how I'm progressing in the game.
    - As a first time visitor,  I want to know if I've won or lost the game.

- Returning Visitor

    - As a returning visitor, I want to be able to quickly jump back into another game if I've won or lost.
    - As a returning visitor, I want to be notified if I have tried to access a page that does not exist.

- Website Administrator

    - As a website administrator, I want to provide links to my social media channels.

### Color Scheme
The colors selected for the color palette are colors that are usually associated with Formula One:
- Red for the lights out signal to start the race.
- White and black for the chequered flag and green
- Yellow to indicate to drivers if there is caution ahead
- Green to dictate that normal racing can resume.

Google Fonts was used to import the 'Russo One' and the 'Exo 2' fonts into the style.css file for use across all pages.

### Wireframes
Each link contains wireframes for mobile, tablet and desktop.

### Scorecard and game progress message board.
The score card displays the number of card held by the player and the computer. The message board displays an initital message to confirm the game has started and will then display who won the previous round or if it was a tie.

### Manual Testing and Results
Here is a table of the manual testing done on the site to determine if all features work as described and designed:

|Feature Tested|Required Action|Expected Outcome|Result|
|---|---|---|---|
|Social media links (all pages)|Click the Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn icons in the footer|Links should direct to social media channels in a new window|Social media channels load successfully|
|Play Game button(index page)|Click the green button labelled 'Play Game'|This should load the game.html page and the game starts|Game.html loads and the game starts|
|Player option inputs highlight on mouse over (game page)|Place the cursor over one of the 5 stats for the player to choose from|The 5 stats in yellow background highlights in red when the pointer moves over them|Background changes colour on placing the cursor on them|
|Player and Computer card count changes (game page)|Select and click on one of the player cards stats|If Player wins the round, card increases by one and Computer's decreases by 1 and vice versa. If stat selected is same between both the scores remain the same|Card count increases and decreases as expected|

### User Story Testing

### Lighthouse Test

### Resposiveness

### Bugs
|Bug Number|Expected|Actual|Fix|
|---|---|---|---|
|Bug 1|Nationality should display the drivers Nationality|Nationality on the active computer card was displaying a number|The code was pointing to the number of drivers championships rather than the nationality. Amending the code to look at the nationality inside the active card object resolved the issue|
|Bug 2|The game function should continue until either the computer or the player has all 20 cards|After approximately 10 games the game would stop unexpectedly and the console would display 'Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'img1')'|I reached out to the #project-milestone-2 channel for some guidance. After some initial guidance from Joy Zadan I was able to resolve the issue by moving the displayImages and displayDriverStats into the assignCurrentCard function. I was then able to further improve the code with the help of Joy Zadan to a length check of the playerCards and currentCards to ensure they were greater than zero before assigning the next random card available|
|Bug 3|The message and score boards should remain in their own separate containers|Overlapping text between the message board and the scoreboard|the height of the message board container had been set to 30px. I changed this to the minimum height which resolved the issue|
